# Old Fashioned Ping Pong
This is my c++/QT based version of the first game I played in my life, this single ping pong. I'm using singletons and a timer for processing all the status of the gameboard. All the items move at the same speed, the ball is always moving in a 45 degrees angule, so it coulbe be nice to add more variation to that.

The implementation is very simple but it kind of work.

Best Regards.
